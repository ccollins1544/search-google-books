# Search Google Books

This app searches books on via the google books api and allows the user to save books. 

By default all books are saved to the demo user account which can be accessed with 

```
user: demo
password: 1234
```

If a user wants to register the saved books will be saved for the user logged in. That way logging in only shows the books saved by the logged in user.
